# 🎉 Squeak - Comprehensive Input Made Easy! 🐭✨

## 🌍📚 What is Squeak?
**Squeak** is the most convenient and easy-to-use source of "comprehensive input" for language learners! 

Unlike solutions like Duolingo or Babbel, comprehensive input is the [proven way to actually learn a language](https://sdkrashen.com/content/articles/case_for_comprehensible_input.pdf). As fun as these apps can be sometimes, nothing replaces REAL exposure to a language - its how babies, immigrants, etc. learn so fast.

*So what is **Squeak**?*

Squeak is a platform for daily stories built for language learning, powered by the most powerful multi-language model in the industry.
Squeak stories are:
- **Tailored**: Pick a specific difficulty level ([CEFR](https://danteinlinea.com/blog/en/the-cefr-levels/)) for YOUR proficiency. No need to read frustratingly simple stories or things with way too many big words.
- **Fascinating**: Read fiction, today's news, or even a fascinating recounting of the 2016 NBA Finals...
- **Easy**: Click a word and get its translation *instantly*, along with the sentence around it. No need for a book on the left, dictionary on the right.
- **Native**: Read stories for 101 languages generated based on real writing snippets from native speakers.

## 🔥 Features
- 🌐 **Multi-language Support**: Generate stories in all of our supported languages!
- 💡 **Dynamic Word Definitions**: Click on any word in the generated story to see its definition and translation!
- 🎯 **Tailored to Learning Level**: Choose your preferred CEFR level (A1, A2, B1, B2, C1, C2).

## Supported Languages
It's actually very easy, code-wise, to add more languages - so feel free to open a PR. It legitimately takes less than 10 minutes.
- French
- Spanish

## How to Use
**Squeak** uses Cohere's Aya 35B model to generate stories and Google's Cloud Translate API for definitions. We recommend getting your own trial key! Both platforms are free for non-commercial and individual use.
