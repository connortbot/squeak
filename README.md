# Squeak - Comprehensive Input Made Easy! 🐭

## 🌍📚 What is Squeak?
**Squeak** is the most convenient and easy-to-use source of "comprehensive input" for language learners! 

Unlike solutions like Duolingo or Babbel, comprehensive input is the [proven way to actually learn a language](https://sdkrashen.com/content/articles/case_for_comprehensible_input.pdf). As fun as these apps can be sometimes, nothing replaces REAL exposure to a language - its how babies, immigrants, etc. learn so fast.

*So what is **Squeak**?*

Squeak is a platform for daily stories built for language learning, powered by the most powerful multi-language model in the industry.
Squeak stories are:
- **Tailored**: Pick a specific difficulty level ([CEFR](https://danteinlinea.com/blog/en/the-cefr-levels/)) for YOUR proficiency. No need to read frustratingly simple stories or things with way too many big words.
- **Fascinating**: Read fiction, today's news, or even a fascinating recounting of the 2016 NBA Finals...
- **Easy**: Click a word and get its translation *instantly*, along with the sentence around it. No need for a book on the left, dictionary on the right.
- **Native**: Read stories for 101 languages generated based on real writing snippets from native speakers.
